Project: Compliment Generator  (https://compliment-generator-asz4.onrender.com)

Description:

Looking to spread some cheer and sunshine online? ☀️ My Compliment Generator is a fun and interactive website built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS, a REST API, and Axios . Users simply enter their name (and maybe a little wink ), and the website generates a personalized compliment just for them! ✨  It's a great way to brighten someone's day and showcase some of my web development skills.
